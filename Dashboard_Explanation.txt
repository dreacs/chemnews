ChemMarket Intel Dashboard - General Overview

What is this Dashboard?
This dashboard is designed specifically for procurement managers to track real-time market sentiment for five key materials:
1. Acetone
2. Ammonia
3. Methanol
4. Caustic Soda
5. Brent Crude Oil (the core energy benchmark driving chemical feedstock costs)

Instead of manually reading through dozens of news articles every morning, the dashboard automatically gathers the latest headlines and uses AI (Google Gemini) to instantly tell you whether the news implies a "Bullish" (prices going up), "Bearish" (prices going down), or "Neutral" market impact.

Where Does the Data Come From?
The dashboard aggregates market intelligence from a wide variety of industry-leading publications and associations that cover both the chemical and broader energy/oil markets. The primary sources include:

1. ICIS (Independent Commodity Intelligence Services)
   - Used for broad coverage on chemical spot markets, fertilizers, and downstream demand.
2. Argus Media
   - Checked for pricing methodologies and contract negotiations for both chemicals and crude oil globally.
3. S&P Global Platts
   - Monitored for deep petrochemical assessments, crude oil benchmarks, and supply-chain disruptions.
4. Reuters Commodities & Energy
   - A rapid, top-tier source for breaking macroeconomic news, OPEC+ decisions, and Brent Crude Oil price action.
5. Bloomberg Markets
   - Tracks the intersection of financial markets, energy trading, and chemical industry equities.
6. OilPrice.com
   - Highly specific, real-time coverage tailored directly to Brent Crude and fossil fuel supply shifts.
7. EuroChlor
   - The primary source for official European production rates, plant utilization, and Chlor-alkali industry news (Caustic Soda).

How Does It Work?
1. Fetching: The system pulls the latest headlines, focusing on European chemical dynamics and global oil trends. 
2. AI Analysis: Google's AI reads each headline (and the snippet if available) and decides what effect it will have on pricing and supply.
3. Timeline Display: The news is plotted on a vertical timeline. 
   - Green items are "Bullish"
   - Red items are "Bearish"
   - Purple items are "Neutral"
4. Daily Calendar: You can click on specific days on the calendar to see exactly how many positive or negative news events occurred on that date over the last two months.

This provides an immediate, aggregated view of the market without requiring you to visit multiple news websites.
